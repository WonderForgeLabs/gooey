// The version a nested module REQUIRES of core is the one line in this
// repo that nothing in this repo reads.
//
// `go.work` resolves every sibling to the checkout beside it, so the
// require is inert here — CLAUDE.md's "One workspace" section says so
// outright: "`go test` in a nested module is no longer testing that
// module against what it *requires*". CI inherits the same workspace,
// because its legs `cd` into each module inside this checkout. And the
// `replace … => ../..` that nine of these modules carry cannot close the
// gap, because a replace in a DEPENDENCY's go.mod is ignored by whoever
// depends on it; it applies only here, where the workspace has already
// made it redundant.
//
// So the require is read for the first time on a stranger's machine, by
// `go get`. Every nested module said `v0.0.0` — not a tag, not a
// pseudo-version, nothing a proxy can serve:
//
//	go: github.com/WonderForgeLabs/gooey/imagefmt/svg@latest requires
//	    github.com/WonderForgeLabs/gooey@v0.0.0: reading
//	    github.com/WonderForgeLabs/gooey/go.mod at revision v0.0.0:
//	    unknown revision v0.0.0
//
// That made every consumable module in the tree — imagefmt/svg, paint,
// mcp, grpc, handlers/* — impossible to `go get`, while all 25 modules
// stayed green in here. Nobody inside the workspace could reach the
// failure, which is why it survived: the tree is not the environment the
// line is for.
//
// THE apps/* MODULES ARE A DIFFERENT CASE and this comment used to
// claim them: "every apps/* one impossible to `go install`", as though
// fixing the require fixed that too. It does not. `go install pkg@ver`
// refuses any target module whose own go.mod carries `replace`
// directives, and it refuses BEFORE resolving a single require —
// measured against a published commit:
//
//	go install github.com/WonderForgeLabs/gooey/apps/introdeck@e5cdb56…
//	go: … contains one or more replace directives. It must not contain
//	    directives that would cause it to be interpreted differently
//	    than if it were the main module.
//
// Every apps/* go.mod carries them, so those modules stay
// un-installable whatever this guard says — a real pin resolving fine
// and the install failing anyway. What the pin buys is `go get` of the
// LIBRARY modules, where a replace in a dependency's go.mod is ignored
// rather than fatal. Raised in review of #497.
//
// This test reads the require rather than resolving around it, so it is
// the only mechanism in the repo that can see the defect at all. It
// deliberately does NOT check that a version resolves — that needs the
// network, and this suite is meant to pass against the vendor directory
// with the network off. It checks the sentinel that can never resolve
// under any conditions, which is the part that does not need a proxy to
// know.
//
// EVERY MODULE IN THIS TREE, not just core. The guard read `r.Path !=
// core` for its whole life, and the blind spot that left was not
// hypothetical: handlers/temporal required
// packs/temporal-visibility at `v0.0.0`, and nineteen more sibling
// requires across apps/* said the same — one `go get` away from the
// identical "unknown revision v0.0.0", and invisible here because the
// path was not core's. The argument in the paragraphs above never
// depended on WHICH module is required; it depends on the require being
// read outside this workspace, which is true of a sibling exactly as it
// is of core. Raised in review of #497.
